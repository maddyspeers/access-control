# Rogue Access Point Attack - Mitigation Plan  
**Group 12:** Brianna Deaubler, Madelyn Speers, Angelin Benny, Daut Hadzijusufovic  
**Course:** CIS4219 - Human Aspects of Cybersecurity  
**Date:** November 18, 2024  

## üìå Overview  
This README outlines our team‚Äôs mitigation strategy for defending against a rogue access point (AP) attack in a mid-sized organization located in a secure, multi-floor building. While physical security is strong, the lack of a Network Access Control (NAC) system created a gap that led to the theft of corporate trade secrets. After thorough analysis, we evaluated three solutions and selected **MAC address filtering** as the most practical, cost-effective option to enhance network security.

## üß† What is a Rogue AP?  
A **rogue access point** is an unauthorized device connected to a network, potentially allowing attackers to bypass security and access sensitive information. These can be installed physically or remotely and are often used to steal data by mimicking trusted network devices.

---

## üîç Incident Summary  
- **Cause:** A rogue AP was likely connected to an unused Ethernet port or configured using a company device.  
- **Vulnerability:** Lack of NAC system despite high physical security.  
- **Impact:** Theft of trade secrets and exposure of internal network.

## üõ°Ô∏è Mitigation Techniques Considered

### 1. Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)  
- **What it does:** Real-time monitoring and blocking of malicious traffic.  
- **Tools:** Open-source solutions like Snort.  
- **Pros:** Automated detection, real-time alerts, works well in Ethernet environments.  
- **Cons:** Moderate cost, ongoing maintenance, potential false positives.

### 2. MAC Address Filtering ‚úÖ *(Chosen Solution)*  
- **What it does:** Allows only pre-approved MAC addresses to connect to the network.  
- **Pros:** Moderate cost, strong control over device access, effective in a physically secured environment.  
- **Cons:** Requires ongoing list management, vulnerable to MAC spoofing.

### 3. Employee Cybersecurity Training  
- **What it does:** Educates employees on detecting rogue APs, phishing, and social engineering.  
- **Pros:** Low cost, raises awareness, improves overall cyber hygiene.  
- **Cons:** Not foolproof, dependent on employee engagement and retention.

## ‚úÖ Why We Chose MAC Address Filtering  
MAC address filtering offered the best **balance between security and cost**. With a well-managed list of company-owned devices and strong physical access controls already in place, this method gives us direct control over network access without major budget or infrastructure changes.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Highlights  
1. **Register Devices:** Collect and verify MAC addresses of all approved company devices.  
2. **Configure Access Points/Switches:** Restrict connections to registered MACs.  
3. **Policy Enforcement:** Regularly update address lists as devices are added or removed.  
4. **Monitoring:** Set up alerts for unauthorized access attempts.  
5. **Routine Audits:** Perform checks to detect spoofing attempts and ensure list accuracy.

---

## üí° Supplementary Measures  
Although MAC filtering was chosen as the main solution, **IPS** and **employee training** will be considered as secondary reinforcements to create a multi-layered defense strategy. Together, these techniques help defend against both technical and human-based threats.
